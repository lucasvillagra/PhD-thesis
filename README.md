# Code for the Ph.D. thesis: Q-curves and Hecke characters in the modular method.

This git repository contains files related to the computational part of the Ph.D. thesis: Q-curves and Hecke characters in the modular method. It contains the codes used to run "Mazur's trick", ir order to discard the newforms, and also the code to compute Ellenberg's bounds. It also includes the codes to compute some of the tables that appear in the thesis. You can find the outputs each folder.

# Contents:

**• mazur.m, Mazur42p.m, Mazur26p.m** : To run Mazur's trick, in Magma.

**• Minimal_model** :  This folder contains the files "Curves_d=n.sage" for n=5,7,11,15., with the minimal models of the curves that appear in the paper (in Sage).

**• Minimal_model** :  This folder contains the files "Multi-Frey.m" and "Codesd4.m", needed to run the file "Cased4.m", in Magma.

**• Cased4.m** : The code used in Theorem A.8, in Magma.

**• Outputs.txt** :  A file that shows the outputs of "Casedn.m/gp", for n=5,7,11,13,15,19.
